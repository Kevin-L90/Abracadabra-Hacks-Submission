# Harry-Potter-Bullet-Hell

For the May 7-9, 2021 Abracadabra Hackathon, Harry Potter Bullet Hell was resurrected. Be the hero just like in the Harry Potter series as a wizard. Fight against evil. Dodge. Cast spells. Repeat. You begin in Level 1 and progress forward. Each level gets increasingly challenging. You only have 3 health bars before dying. Can your magic withstand evil? Our registered domain is harrypotterbullethell.co. The Hackathon is Annaliese's and Kevin's first hackathon. 

# ðŸ’­What Inspired Us

We believe Harry Potter encompasses the meaning of magic, the global populations familiarized themselves with the Harry Potter franchise, and we have previous experience as gaming users, such as League of Legends.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Racket, GRacket

We have used the advanced student language in DrRacket [version 7.9]. All lack of functionality is due to time restrictions. DrRocket was used to build the entire game from scratch. Figma and Canva assisted us in the visual design. We opted in for simplicity as beginner hackers. GRacket was used as our cheif editor and there are an abundance of labels in the code, such as the layout and moving parts.

## Optimizations

Here are the challenges we faced... Level 2 and Level 3 are not fully coded, in addition to villain functionality. 2 group members dropped out without warning. Talent gaps occurred. There was a debugging process in Level 1 with having villains to fight back. Future versions can include Level 2 and Level 3 being fully coded and to fix errors earlier in the process before moving forward. 

## Lessons Learned:

Number one: Abracadabra is both of our first hackathons. We learned how to utilize advanced student language known as DrRacket better. Number two: How to design compelling artwork and time management. Number three: How to work digitally as a team in terms of communication and giving feedback. Although we have been awarded with the best apprentice hack, the coding and design journey are far from over. We will continue our best work.
